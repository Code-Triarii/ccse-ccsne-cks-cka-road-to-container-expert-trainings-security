# GitLab Setup with Ansible

This directory contains resources for setting up GitLab using Ansible. It includes configuration for GitLab itself as well as GitLab Runner.

## Requirements

- `Docker Compose pip library installed`: pip install docker-compose

## Directory Structure

```
environment/
	gitlab/
		env_vars.yml
		install_gitlab.yml
		secret_vars.yml
		README.md
		.gitignore
```

## Files

- [`env_vars.yml`](env_vars.yml): This file contains the environment variables needed for the GitLab setup.

- [`install_gitlab.yml`]("install_gitlab.yml"): This is the main Ansible playbook that sets up GitLab.

- [`secret_vars.yml`]("secret_vars.yml"): This file contains sensitive variables such as passwords and secret keys.

- [`.gitignore`](".gitignore"): This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Usage

To use these resources to set up GitLab, run the [`install_gitlab.yml`]("install_gitlab.yml") playbook with the [`env_vars.yml`]("env_vars.yml") file as extra variables and the `.vault_pass.txt` file for the vault password:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_gitlab.yml -e env_vars.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass.txt
```

This command will start the Ansible playbook that sets up GitLab. The `-e` option is used to specify the [`env_vars.yml`]("env_vars.yml") file as extra variables, and the `--vault-password-file` option is used to specify the `.vault_pass.txt` file for the vault password.

Please replace `.vault_pass.txt` with your actual vault password file.


> [!NOTE]
> After the playbook is executed, you will be able to access the Gitlab UI (it takes 2 mins for set-up approximately) with a docker gitlab runner already configured ðŸ˜‰
