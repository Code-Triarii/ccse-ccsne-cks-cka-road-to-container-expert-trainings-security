## Docker

### Docker achitecture

![Docker architecture](docs/img/ccse-docker-architecture.png)

Docker is a powerful platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker's architecture is key to its functionality, enabling both development and operations teams to work more efficiently. Here's an overview of Docker's architecture within a 70-line constraint:

#### Docker Engine

The Docker Engine is the core of Docker, a lightweight and powerful open-source containerization technology combined with a workable API. The Engine creates and manages Docker containers. It's a client-server based application comprising three major components:

1. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`):** The server part of the engine that listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It's the process that actually executes the containers.

2. **REST API:** An interface that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.

3. **Docker CLI (`docker`):** The command line interface that allows users to interact with Docker using commands.

#### Docker Objects

- **Images:** An immutable file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images serve as the basis of containers. An image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.

- **Containers:** An abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same hardware more efficiently than if using virtual machines. Containers are created from images, and they can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted.

- **Volumes:** Provide persistent storage for a Docker container. They are essential for when you need to store data generated by and used by Docker containers.

- **Networks:** Enable isolated networks to be defined and managed by Docker. They provide connectivity between containers on the same host or across different hosts.

### Docker alternatives

1. [Podman](https://podman.io/) - Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
2. [CRI-O:](https://cri-o.io/) - Container management solution optimized for Kubernetes compliant with OCI specification.
3. [Linux Containers - LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/getting-started/)

### Docker Networking

Docker supports multiple networking options, each tailored for specific use cases:

- **Bridge:** The default network driver, suitable for containers' communication on the same host.
- **Host:** Removes network isolation between container and host, offering performance improvement.
- **Overlay:** Enables network communication between containers across different hosts, crucial for Docker Swarm.
- **Macvlan:** Allows assigning a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
- **None:** Disables all networking, useful for containers that don't require network communication.
