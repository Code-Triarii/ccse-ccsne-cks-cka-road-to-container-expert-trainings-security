# Exercise X: Static Analysis of Docker Images for Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge

Your objective in this exercise is to perform static analysis on Docker images to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations using three prominent tools: Grype, Trivy, and Clair. These tools offer comprehensive scanning capabilities to detect security issues within container images, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of your containerized applications. By conducting these analyses, you'll gain insights into potential vulnerabilities and configuration flaws that could compromise your container security. Completing this challenge will enhance your understanding of container security scanning technologies and best practices for maintaining secure Docker images.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- [ ] Install and configure Grype, Trivy, and Clair on your system.
- [ ] Perform a vulnerability scan on a Docker image using Grype and output the report in a machine-readable format.
- [ ] Use Trivy to scan the same Docker image for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, ensuring the output is in a machine-readable format.
- [ ] Conduct a vulnerability assessment of the Docker image with Clair and generate a report in a machine-readable format.
- [ ] Compare and analyze the results obtained from Grype, Trivy, and Clair to understand the unique capabilities and coverage of each tool.
- [ ] Document the setup process, scan commands, and findings for each tool. Include any troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered during the scanning process.

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> If you want to include those steps in a CICD pipeline, you can utilize the [Gitlab Set-up from environment](../../environment/gitlab/README.md).
