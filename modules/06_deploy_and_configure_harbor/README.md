# Exercise 6: Deploy and Configure Harbor with HTTPS and Trivy Scanner
## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge
Your objective in this exercise is to deploy Harbor, an open-source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. You will configure Harbor to use HTTPS for secure communication, set up authentication, and integrate Trivy for automated vulnerability scanning of images. Completing this challenge will deepen your understanding of container image security, registry management, and the application of best practices in securing Docker images.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- [ ] Deploy Harbor using Docker or Docker Compose with HTTPS enabled.
- [ ] Configure authentication in Harbor to secure access.
- [ ] Upload container images to Harbor and verify they are accessible.
- [ ] List images in Harbor to ensure correct deployment and configuration.
- [ ] Configure Harbor to use the Trivy scanner for automatic vulnerability analysis of stored images.
- [ ] Document the deployment process, configuration steps, and how to interact with Harbor securely.
