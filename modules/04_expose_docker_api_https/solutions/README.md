# Solution Guide: Securely Exposing Docker Daemon over HTTPS

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for securely exposing the Docker daemon over HTTPS. By configuring the Docker daemon with TLS certificates, you ensure that all communications are both encrypted and authenticated, significantly enhancing the security of Docker operations.

## Requirements for this exercise

- Docker installed and running on your system.
- OpenSSL for generating TLS certificates.
- Sudo access to configure the Docker daemon.
- Understanding of TLS/SSL for secure communications.

Based on the provided Ansible playbook and the requirement to update the markdown documentation to include Ansible steps for securely exposing the Docker daemon over HTTPS, here's how you can update the markdown documentation:

## Step by step - Ansible

For those preferring an automated setup using Ansible, follow these steps:

### 1. Prepare Ansible Playbook

The provided Ansible playbook automates the process of generating TLS certificates, configuring the Docker daemon for HTTPS, and setting up the Docker CLI to securely connect to the daemon.

### 2. Execute Ansible Playbook

Run the Ansible playbook to securely expose your Docker daemon over HTTPS:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml set_docker_daemon_https.yml -e ansible_user=$(id -un) -vv
```

### 3. Verify Configuration

After the playbook execution, verify the Docker daemon is correctly configured to use TLS for all connections:

```bash
docker --context secure-context ps
```

## Step by step - Manual

### Step 1: Generate TLS Certificates

To establish a trusted connection between the Docker daemon and clients, you will generate the CA, server, and client certificates.

#### Requirements

- OpenSSL installed on your system.

#### Generating Certificates

1. **Create a CA (Certificate Authority):**
   Generate a private key and a CA certificate that will be used to sign the server and client certificates.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca-key.pem 4096
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem -subj "/CN=<DOCKER_HOST>"
   ```

2. **Create a Server Key and Certificate:**
   Generate a private key for the server, create a certificate signing request (CSR), and sign it with the CA certificate.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 4096
   openssl req -subj "/CN=<DOCKER_HOST>" -new -key server-key.pem -out server.csr
   # Prepare the san.cnf file for server certificate (Adjust the san.cnf content as needed)
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -extfile san.cnf -extensions v3_req
   ```

3. **Create a Client Key and Certificate:**
   Generate a private key for the client, create a CSR, and sign it with the CA certificate. Ensure the client certificate is configured for client authentication.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out client-key.pem 4096
   openssl req -subj "/CN=client" -new -key client-key.pem -out client.csr
   # Prepare the san.cnf file for client certificate (Adjust the client_san.cnf content as needed)
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client-cert.pem -extfile client_san.cnf -extensions v3_req
   ```

### Step 2: Configure the Docker Daemon

Configure the Docker daemon to use the generated certificates, requiring TLS for all connections.

1. **Update Docker Daemon Configuration:**
   Modify the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file to include the TLS configuration and specify the host option to listen on TCP port 2376.

   ```json
   {
     "tlsverify": true,
     "tlscacert": "/path/to/ca.pem",
     "tlscert": "/path/to/server-cert.pem",
     "tlskey": "/path/to/server-key.pem",
     "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2376"]
   }
   ```

2. **Modify the Docker Service File:**
   Edit `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` to remove the `-H fd://` option from the `ExecStart` line and ensure Docker listens on the configured TCP port.

   ```bash
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd
   ```

3. **Reload Systemd and Restart Docker:**
   Apply the changes by reloading the systemd daemon and restarting the Docker service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

### Step 3: Securely Connect Docker CLI

Set environment variables to use the client certificates when connecting to the Docker daemon and create a Docker context for easier management.

1. **Set Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
   export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://<DOCKER_HOST>:2376"
   export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/path/to/certificates"
   ```

2. **Create a Docker Context:**
   This step simplifies the process of switching between different Docker daemon configurations.

   ```bash
   docker context create secure-context --docker "host=tcp://<DOCKER_HOST>:2376,ca=<path_to_ca.pem>,cert=<path_to_client-cert.pem>,key=<path_to_client-key.pem>"
   ```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

Verify the secure connection by executing a Docker CLI command, such as listing containers, using the newly created context.

```bash
docker --context secure-context ps
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations on successfully configuring your Docker daemon to securely expose its API over HTTPS! This setup not only encrypts communication but also requires proper authentication, significantly enhancing the security of your Docker environment. By following these steps, you have taken a critical step in securing Docker daemon communications. Remember, maintaining security involves regular updates and audits of your configurations and certificates. ðŸŽ‰
