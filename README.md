<!-- PROJECT DETAILS -->

## 💡 Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to be guiding for anyone interested in obtaining the CCSE certification. Explaining in detail exercises, including automations for quickly setting up a testing environment and more.

If you are learning about container security and willing to obtain the CCSE certification, this is your place.

## 🏗️ Project structure

A quick tour on how the project is organized here:

- `docs`: contains the main .md files for documenting the project as well as the images used in the markdown for renderization.
- `environment`: this folder includes the different automatic resources for setting up the environment required for the different exercises.
- `modules` > `exercises`: this folder contains the module distribution based on the CCSE path and the different exercises created for preparation.
- `theorical concepts`: including important theory that supports the foundations understanding and good comprehension of the practical exercises [here](./concepts.md).
- `auxiliar commands and tips`: section that contains one liners, useful executions and more [here](./auxiliar-commands-and-tips.md).

## 📍 Roadmap

- [ ] Create automatic deployment of scenarios.
- [x] Include theory and useful tips.
- [x] Create comprehensive guide with security measures for holistic container protection.
- [x] Complete the full CCSE path with scenarios and exercises including documentation for each of them.
  - [x] Set docker registry V2 securely.
  - [x] Interact with docker API server using python Docker SDK
  - [x] Samples of interaction with Docker daemon through API rest.
  - [x] How to configure Docker Daemon over HTTPS.
